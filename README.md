# SMU_CaseStudy_12_NeuralNetworks (Python)

Case study for MS Data Science. Work done in collaboration with Kevin Cannon.

A subset of the Higgs Data Set is used to experiment and explore neural networks with the Keras API. Three different architectures, optimizers, and initializers are explored and scored to produce a final model score.
